# Weather App README 🌦️

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information of a specific city. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input and displays the relevant weather details on the user interface.

## Features ⭐

- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter the name of a city in the search input field and click the search button to retrieve weather information for that city.
- **Weather Display:** Once a valid city name is entered and the search button is clicked, the app displays the current weather information for the specified city. This includes the city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app also displays an appropriate weather icon and adjusts the background color based on the weather condition.
- **Error Handling:** If the entered city name is not found in the OpenWeatherMap API, an error message is displayed to inform the user of the invalid input.
